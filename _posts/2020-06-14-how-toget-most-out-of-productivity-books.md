- Reading books is regarded as a highly effective practice for gaining knowledge and leveraging other people's experiences while solving your own problems.

- But still we come accross people in our life who are not doing great but claim to have been reading a LOT of productivity and other self improvement books.

- These people fall in the trap of consuming too much content and not acting on any of it.

- < Get a reference for this > An average CEO reads about 50 books per year.

- So if you look at these 2 sets of people you would realize that to get the maximum value out of any book, how you read a book also matters a lot apart from the contents of the book.

- The plan I follow while reading productivity and other self improvement books.

- Read the book once <EXPAND>
  
 - Re-read and prepare chapter wise notes and Action Items <EXPAND>
    Application that I use to quickly churn out notes.
    < Mention about active and passive learning >
    < Mention why Action items are important >
  
  - Have a workshop with yourself listing down the action items <EXPAND>
    < Include a photo of your workshop >
    < Talk about the tools you use for the workshop >
    < Mention the fee these authors take for the actual workshops that are conducted at corporate level >
      
- Don't recommend any books for now. This might be a separate topic altogether.
