Reading books is regarded as a highly effective practice for gaining knowledge and leveraging other people's experiences while solving your own problems.

But still we all have come accross people in our life who are not doing great but claim to have been reading a LOT of productivity and other self improvement books.

On the other hand according to a survey conducted recently, an average CEO reads about 40 to 50 books per year. So if you consider CEOs to be highly accompalished individuals you realise that not just the content of these books but also how one reads a book matters a lot.

< Instead of saying that CEOs read a LOT of Books, just mention that CEOs credit book reading a lot in achieving what they have achieved. Give a few examples of guys like Bill Gates, etc. >

###### The Trap
This huge difference in output is largely due to the fact that most people wall in the classic trap of consuming too much content and not acting on any of it.

###### Why we don't do it < Think about a better title >
I can think of two primary reasons why we go after reading more books than to take the maximum value out of a book.

- We go after stuff we can measure.
In this data driven world we often end up giving more value to things that we can measure than things that cannot be measured. Number of books you have read can be measured but it might not be a good accurate reflection of the impact this acitvity might have had on your life and your business. Instead of going after the actual end goal sometimes we end up chasing the thing we can measure. But as the the economist Charles Goodhart says “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”

- Tendency of Human Mind to go after novelty.
< Mention the quote from Atomic Habits that says that even if something is working for you, you end up changing the routine because it gets boring >
- Reading a new book feels more exciting than squezzing learnings out of a book you've read already in a hurry.

- Bragging/Show Off
< EXPAND >

###### Realization vs Knowledge vs Applied Knowledge
When we first come across an idea that resonates with us where we enter a state of realization as we begin to link the idea with our own experiences.

< EXAMPLE >
With enough repition <BETTER WORD>, this idea becomes ingrained in our brains and becomes part of our knowledge base.
  
Reaching this state might give you a sense of achivement of learning something new but when you think about it there are no changes in your life or your decisions based on this newly acquired knowledge. 
  
Only when you start applying this newly acquired knowledge <THINK OF A BETTER WORD> while solving your problems and making decisions, you begin to bear fruits of your labour.

Applying the gained wisdom to your life or business closes the activity and only now you can expect any reward coming your way.


###### The How
I've been experimenting with ways of  
- The plan I follow while reading productivity and other self improvement books.

- Read the book once <EXPAND>
  
 - Re-read and prepare chapter wise notes and Action Items <EXPAND>
    Application that I use to quickly churn out notes.
    < Mention about active and passive learning >
    < Mention why Action items are important >
  
  - Have a workshop with yourself listing down the action items <EXPAND>
    < Include a photo of your workshop >
    < Talk about the tools you use for the workshop >
    < Mention the fee these authors take for the actual workshops that are conducted at corporate level >
 
###### Conclusion
- Keep the end goal in mind when you pick up a self improvement book. It is Self Improvement, not bragging or anything else.
