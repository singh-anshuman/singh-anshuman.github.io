Reading books is regarded as a highly effective practice for gaining knowledge and leveraging other people's experiences while solving your own problems.

But still we all have come accross people in our life who are not doing great but claim to have been reading a LOT of productivity and other self improvement books.

On the other hand according to a survey conducted recently, an average CEO reads about 40 to 50 books per year. So if you consider CEOs to be highly accompalished individuals you can realise that not just the content of these books but also how once reads a book matters a lot.

The Trap
This is largely due to the fact that most people wall in the classic trap of consuming too much content and not acting on any of it.

Realization vs Knowledge vs Applied Knowledge
When we first come across an idea that resonates with us where we enter a state of realization as we begin to link the idea with our own experiences.

< EXAMPLE >
With enough repition <BETTER WORD>, this idea becomes ingrained in our brains and becomes part of our knowledge base.
  
- Up until this point you would feel a sense of achivement of learning something new but when you think about it there are no changes in your life or your decisions. 
  
Only when you start applying this newly acquired knowledge while solving your problems and making decisions, you begin to bear fruits of your labour.

- If you don't make sure that you are closing this last phase, sadly there will be no rewards to be enjoyed.  


The How
I've been experimenting with ways of  
- The plan I follow while reading productivity and other self improvement books.

- Read the book once <EXPAND>
  
 - Re-read and prepare chapter wise notes and Action Items <EXPAND>
    Application that I use to quickly churn out notes.
    < Mention about active and passive learning >
    < Mention why Action items are important >
  
  - Have a workshop with yourself listing down the action items <EXPAND>
    < Include a photo of your workshop >
    < Talk about the tools you use for the workshop >
    < Mention the fee these authors take for the actual workshops that are conducted at corporate level >
      
- Don't recommend any books for now. This might be a separate topic altogether.
