Every resident of New Delhi and adjoining cities like Gurugram, Noida, Gaziabad, Faridabad, etc. is a stakeholder in this debate. 

Having collected a lot of data and spent hours researching on this topic (and also having lived through the pollution season), if you ask me, I would say that if anything Delhi's air pollution is highly UNDERRATED.

#### Why is it a big deal ?

#### Argument that so many people are living for decades in Delhi

#### How what can you do an Individual level is not enough

#### Why I stopped taking precautionary measures by looking at other people ?

#### Why you don't see the situation improving ?

#### How many countries/cities have successfully tackled this problem.

#### What can India do about it ?

#### Delhi's comparision with other Indian cities.
